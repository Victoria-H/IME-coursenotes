	In French this relates to Leroi-Gourhan

	* Neutrality of Technology
		* Kranzberg's laws of technology
	
		Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.
	
		Invention is the mother of necessity.......
		
		Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.
		
		
Other thoughts and references
-----------------------------

* WISE - world innovation summit for education [Noam Chomsky](http://learning-reimagined.com/noam-chomsky-on-technology-learning/)

		As far as technology itself and education is concerned, technology is basically neutral. It’s like a hammer. The hammer doesn’t care whether you use it to build a house or whether on torture, using it to crush somebody’s skull, the hammer can do either.
 
		Noam Chomsky
